#DenseNet121
This repository showcases a deep learning project where DenseNet121, a pretrained convolutional neural network, is fine-tuned using PyTorch for image classification. The model is trained and validated on the Waste Classification Dataset, which consists of organic and recyclable waste images.

The project covers:

  ⚙️ Dataset preparation with stratified train/validation/test splits
  
  🖼️ Data augmentation and normalization using torchvision.transforms
  
  🔥 Fine-tuning DenseNet121 with a custom classifier
  
  📊 Training/validation loops with loss & accuracy tracking
  
  ✅ Evaluation on test data and visualization of predictions
  
  📈 Learning curve plots to analyze performance

This repository is intended as a portfolio project demonstrating transfer learning, model evaluation, and practical PyTorch implementation.
